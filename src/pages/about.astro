        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Indi Watte — a DEVINE student at Howest with a passion for
            combining design and technology to create meaningful digital
            experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests include creative coding, motion design, and exploring
            how people interact with digital products. I enjoy experimenting
            with tools like Astro, JavaScript, and p5.js to bring ideas to life
            on the web.

        <h3>What I’m currently working on</h3>
        <p>
            Building my personal portfolio with Astro and diving deeper into responsive
            design is an interesting and rewarding project. It’s not only a
            chance to explore responsiveness and sharpen my Git skills, but also
            a way to organize and showcase two years of learning, growth,
            challenges, creativity, and moments of both frustration and
            satisfaction.
