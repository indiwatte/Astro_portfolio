For this assignment, I developed a digital-first campaign concept for Thrive, an alcohol-free functional beer brand expanding beyond the sports segment. The goal was to introduce new audiences (ages 25–45) to Thrive Play and Thrive Unwind IPA through an engaging online experience and a strong creative hook.

I designed a campaign website and online strategy that connects storytelling, interactive elements, and participation. The focus was on creating an accessible experience that highlights the beers’ unique benefits while encouraging real-world engagement and user-generated content. My process included research, concept development, wireframing, visual design, and iteration based on feedback.
