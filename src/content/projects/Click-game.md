Description:

Rocket Clicker is a click-driven game where players launch rockets by clicking, earning “Fuel Points” with each click. These points can be spent on upgrades and equipment that either enhance the power of each click or generate automatic Fuel Points over time.

The game adds creative twists: rockets evolve visually as players progress, launch animations respond to clicks, and subtle micro-interactions provide feedback, making every action satisfying. The interface is designed to be visually appealing, with a clean layout, dynamic color scheme, and engaging animations that enhance the overall user experience.

Technically, the project demonstrates:

DOM manipulation and event handling using arrow functions

Persistent progress with localStorage

Timed events with setInterval() and setTimeout()

Interactive CSS animations and micro-interactions

Correct usage of forms for upgrades and item purchases

Rocket Clicker turns the simple act of clicking into an interactive, visually rewarding game, highlighting both programming skill and thoughtful design.
